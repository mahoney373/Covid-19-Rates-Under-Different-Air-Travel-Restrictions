# Covid-19-Rates-Under-Different-Air-Travel-Restrictions
A look at the Covid-19 rates from January 1, 2021 to March 1, 2021 in Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil. 
During this time period each of these three countries had different levels of air travel restrictions.
All code used in the project can be found in the appendix of the BCVcovidAnalysis.Rmd file.
I also included the slides for the presentation I gave and a pdf of my final paper.
